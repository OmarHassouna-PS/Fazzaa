# Security Policy for the Fazzaa Project

## Our Commitment to Security

The Fazzaa project team is committed to ensuring the security of our platform and its users. We understand the importance of protecting user information and strive to maintain the highest standards of security. Your help in reporting vulnerabilities responsibly is greatly appreciated.

## Supported Versions

Project versions that are currently being supported with security updates vary per project.
Please see specific project repositories for details.
If nothing is specified, only the latest major versions are supported.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in the Fazzaa project, we encourage you to let us know right away. We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem. Please follow these steps to report a vulnerability:

1. **Direct Reporting**: Send an email to [info@fazzaa.com](mailto:info@fazzaa.com) (replace with your project's security contact email). Please include a detailed report of the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce, potential impacts, and any other information that may help us understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability.

2. **Do Not Disclose Publicly**: Please do not disclose the vulnerability publicly until we have had a chance to investigate and address the issue. We aim to assess vulnerabilities within a reasonable timeframe and will keep you informed throughout the process.

3. **Anonymity**: If you prefer to remain anonymous, you may do so. We value your contribution and are more interested in understanding and resolving the vulnerability than in your identity.

## Security Update Process

Upon receiving a vulnerability report, the Fazzaa project team will take the following steps:

1. Confirm receipt of your report and begin an investigation.
2. Work to understand the severity and impact of the vulnerability.
3. Develop a fix or mitigation strategy.
4. Release a security update or advisory to the community.
